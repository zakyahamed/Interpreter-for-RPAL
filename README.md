# RPAL Interpreter

This repository contains a lexical analyser and parser for the RPAL language, built for CS3513: Programming Languages.

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
The project requirement was to implement a lexical analyzer and a parser for the RPAL language. The output of the parser should be the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for the given input program. Then an algorithm must be implemented to convert the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) into Standardize Tree (ST) and the CSE machine should be implemented. The program should be able to read an input file that contains an RPAL program. The output of the program should match the output of “rpal.exe“ for the relevant program.

<h3>Program Execution Instructions</h3>
The following sequence of commands can be used in the root of the project directory to compile the program and execute rpal programs:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
